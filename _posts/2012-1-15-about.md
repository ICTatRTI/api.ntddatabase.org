The Facility Registry API is an open standard for sharing and updating health facility data.

To follow or contribute to the discussion related features in the API: see [facility registry github issues](https://github.com/facilityregistry/fred-api/).

The API is an ongoing collaborative effort begun under the Open Facility Registry Service Project:  Facility Registry Expansion Development \(FRED\).

This project is supported by PEPFAR and USAID
